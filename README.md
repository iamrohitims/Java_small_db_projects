# Java DB Project

This repository contains a small Java DB project that I am working on, and I will be contributing more Java projects related to databases in the future. 

## Project Description

The project is a simple Java application that connects to a MySQL database and allows users to add, retrieve, update and delete data from a table. It has a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Swing library, and uses the JDBC API to interact with the database.

The application has the following features:

- Connect to a MySQL database using JDBC
- Add new records to the table
- Retrieve records from the table and display them in a table in the GUI
- Update existing records in the table
- Delete records from the table

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL database server
- MySQL JDBC driver (version 8.0.25 or higher)

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-db-project.git
   ```

2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) as a Maven project.

3. Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and edit the database connection properties to match your MySQL database settings.

4. Run the `App` class to launch the GUI.
